# Dot Painting with Python Turtle

A Python program that generates a colorful 10x10 dot grid using the Turtle graphics module. This project is inspired by modern dot-painting techniques and the work of contemporary artist, Damien Hirst, aiming to combine programming with art. It demonstrates Python programming concepts such as loops, lists, and randomization, making it a creative project.

## Project Overview:

This project creates a visually appealing dot painting using the following steps:

1. **Setup a Turtle Canvas:** Initialize the Turtle graphics window and configure the drawing parameters.
2. **Define a Color Palette:** Use a predefined list of RGB colors, which can be extracted from an image of one of Daniel Hirst's dot paintings.
3. **Draw a Dot Grid:** Use nested loops to draw a 10x10 grid of colored dots, with each dot placed evenly in a grid layout.
4. **Randomize Colors:** Each dot color is chosen randomly from the palette, resulting in a unique artwork each time the program runs.

### Technical Concepts:

1. Python
2. Turtle graphics
3. Loops and data structures
4. Randomization
5. Color palettes and generative art

### Key Features

- Generates a 10x10 grid of dots
- Uses a curated color palette for visually pleasing results
- Randomized color selection ensures unique paintings every run
- Easy to modify: dot size, spacing, and colors can be customized
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly code
