# Dot Painting with Python Turtle

A Python program that generates a colorful 10x10 dot grid using the Turtle graphics module. This project is inspired by modern dot-painting techniques and the work of contemporary artist, Daniel Hirst, aiming to combine programming with art. It demonstrates Python programming concepts such as loops, lists, and randomization, making it a fun project!

## Project Overview

This project creates a visually appealing dot painting using the following steps:

1. **Setup a Turtle Canvas:** Initialize the Turtle graphics window and configure the drawing parameters.
2. **Define a Color Palette:** Use a predefined list of RGB colors, which can be extracted from an image of one of Daniel Hirst's dot paintings.
3. **Draw a Dot Grid:** Use nested loops to draw a 10x10 grid of colored dots, with each dot placed evenly in a grid layout.
4. **Randomize Colors:** Each dot color is chosen randomly from the palette, resulting in a unique artwork each time the program runs.

### Motivation

This project is part of The 100 days of Code Challenge. The goal of this project is to explore how programming can intersect with visual art. By combining Python logic with aesthetic design, it creates a simple yet effective way to experiment with generative art.

### Key Features

- Generates a 10x10 grid of dots
- Uses a curated color palette for visually pleasing results
- Randomized color selection ensures unique paintings every run
- Easy to modify: dot size, spacing, and colors can be customized
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly code
